## About this project

I didn't see many working examples using NuxtJS, so I've decided to create my own basic boilerplate.
nuxt-solana-boilerplate is a Jamstack and open-source boilerplate project that connect your Frontend with the Solana network using the amazing Phantom wallet.

I'm currently working on it to add more features.
